### 96. Contracts vs Policies

**Contracts:**

* Agreement between API consumers and providers.
* Enforce **SLA tiers**, rate limits, and access control.

**Policies:**

* Technical enforcement of rules (e.g., OAuth2, Rate limiting).
* Applied through **API Manager**.

**Difference:**

* **Contracts** control **who** can access.
* **Policies** control **how** they access.

---

### 97. Autodiscovery – What, Why, and How to Link

**What:**

* Mechanism to bind deployed APIs to their API Manager configuration.

**Why:**

* Enables policy enforcement, analytics, monitoring.

**How:**

* Add `apiId` to Mule app using:

```xml
<api-platform:api apiName="my-api" apiVersion="v1" />
```

* Configure properties or include via `mule-artifact.json`

---

### 98. Flex Gateway vs Mule Gateway

**Flex Gateway:**

* Lightweight, high-performance API gateway.
* Used to secure non-Mule APIs (Docker, K8s, VMs).

**Mule Gateway:**

* Embedded into Mule runtime.
* For APIs built and deployed in Mule.

---

### 99. Access Management in Anypoint

**What:**

* Centralized system for managing users, roles, teams, permissions.

**Why:**

* Control platform access and manage org-wide security.

**Supports:**

* SSO, SAML, OAuth
* Role-based access control (RBAC)

---

### 100. Client ID & Secret During Deployment

**Where:**

* Passed in headers to authenticate API consumers.

**Purpose:**

* Enforce contracts and rate limits.
* Do not connect to business systems directly — **only to API Manager** for access control.

---

### 101. SLA Tiers – Basic Concept

**What:**

* Defines **limits** on API access:

  * Requests per minute
  * Response time
  * Retry behavior

**Why:**

* Monetize APIs
* Different levels of service for internal vs external users

---

### 102. What is SonarQube and Nexus Repository?

**SonarQube:**

* Static code analysis tool.
* Finds bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells.

**Nexus:**

* Artifact repository.
* Stores and manages JARs, POMs, etc., used in Maven builds.

---

### 103. Maven – What, Why, Who Handles It

**What:**

* Build automation tool using `pom.xml`

**Why:**

* Dependency management
* Build packaging
* Plugin-based automation

**Who Handles:**

* Developers and DevOps teams via CI/CD

---

### 104. What is `pom.xml`?

**Project Object Model file**

* Manages dependencies
* Defines build lifecycle
* Includes plugins, repositories, project metadata

---

### 105. Maven Build Lifecycle

**Phases:**

* `validate` – Check project structure
* `compile` – Compile source code
* `test` – Run unit tests
* `package` – Create JAR
* `verify` – Run integration tests
* `install` – Copy to local repo
* `deploy` – Push to remote repo

---

### 106. What is a JAR?

**Java ARchive**

* Compressed file containing compiled Java code (.class), libraries, and metadata.

**Used For:**

* Deploying Mule applications or Java libraries.

---

### 107. Build Plugins in pom.xml – What and Why

**What:**

* Tools integrated into Maven builds

**Examples:**

* `maven-compiler-plugin`
* `mule-maven-plugin`

**Why:**

* Automate build, testing, packaging, deployment.

---

### 108. Maven Clean Plugin

**What:**

* Cleans up previous build artifacts (e.g., `target/` directory).

**Usage:**

```bash
mvn clean
```

---

### 109. Mule Maven Plugin – What & Why

**What:**

* Plugin to build and deploy Mule apps via Maven.

**Why:**

* CI/CD integration
* CloudHub, RTF, On-Prem deployment support

**Example:**

```bash
mvn deploy -DmuleDeploy
```

...\[Topics 1–110 remain unchanged]...

---

### 111. Config Shared Library in Mule (pom.xml + Mule)

**What:**

* Shared libraries allow reuse of common modules across multiple Mule projects.

**How:**

1. Package shared logic as a JAR (e.g., custom functions, transformers).
2. Deploy it to Nexus or include as a local dependency.
3. In your `pom.xml`, declare the shared library under `<dependencies>`.

**Example:**

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.myorg</groupId>
  <artifactId>shared-utils</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

---

### 112. `<shared-library>` in Mule

**What:**

* Not a valid Mule-specific tag. Use standard Maven dependency management instead.
* Shared libraries are included through `<dependencies>` in `pom.xml`, not through custom XML.

---

### 113. `<dependencies>` Tag in `pom.xml`

**What:**

* Section where all external and internal library dependencies are declared.

**Fields:**

* `groupId` – Org/namespace
* `artifactId` – Project/module name
* `version` – Specific version

**Why:**

* Maven uses this metadata to fetch JARs and manage transitive dependencies.

---

### 114. How Dependencies Are Fetched in Maven

**Flow:**

1. Searches in **local repository**: `~/.m2/repository`
2. If not found, checks **Maven Central Repository**
3. If defined, checks **Remote Repositories** like Nexus
4. If found, downloaded to **local repo for caching**

**Why:**

* Minimizes redundant downloads and supports offline builds.

---

### 115. `<pluginRepositories>` – What and Why

**What:**

* Specifies repositories for downloading Maven **plugins** (e.g., Mule plugin, compiler plugin).

**Example:**

```xml
<pluginRepositories>
  <pluginRepository>
    <id>mule-plugins</id>
    <url>https://repository.mulesoft.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases/</url>
  </pluginRepository>
</pluginRepositories>
```

**Why:**

* Some plugins may not be on Maven Central and need to be pulled from custom sources.

---

### 116. Include Common Modules in `pom.xml`

**What:**

* Modularize shared logic into reusable JARs.
* Include using standard Maven `<dependency>` tag.

**Example Use Case:**

* Logging module, error handlers, custom DataWeave functions.

**Why:**

* Improves reusability, maintainability, and team collaboration.

---

### 117. Deployment Strategy in `pom.xml`

**Maven Phases Used:**

* `mvn install`: Builds and installs to local repo
* `mvn deploy`: Deploys to remote repo (e.g., Nexus)
* `mvn mule:deploy`: Deploys to CloudHub or on-prem using Mule plugin

**Redeploy & Undeploy:**

* Use Mule Maven Plugin with `goal=undeploy` followed by `deploy`

---

### 118. `<plugin>` Configuration for Remote Deployment (CI/CD)

**Use Case:**

* Automate deployment via Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Azure Pipelines

**Example:**

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.mule.tools.maven</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.3.5</version>
  <configuration>
    <deploymentType>cloudhub</deploymentType>
    <username>${anypoint.username}</username>
    <password>${anypoint.password}</password>
    <environment>Sandbox</environment>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```

---

### 119. CloudHub 2.0 Deployment

**What:**

* Enhanced version of CloudHub with Kubernetes-style scaling, better observability

**Deployment:**

* Still uses Mule Maven Plugin, but targets CH2 platform
* Requires configuration for replica sets, vCores, region, and load balancing

---

### 120. Secure Properties

**What:**

* Encrypt sensitive configuration like DB passwords

**How:**

* Use Mule Secure Property Tool or encrypt values manually
* In `mule-artifact.json`:

```json
{
  "secureProperties": ["db.password"]
}
```

**Usage in app.properties:**

```properties
db.password=![encrypted_value]
```

---

### 121. Include/Exclude Files in Build

**Why:**

* Prevent large binaries, secrets, or test-only files from entering the final build

**Use Plugin:**

```xml
<plugin>
  <artifactId>maven-resources-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <excludes>
      <exclude>**/*.zip</exclude>
    </excludes>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```

---

### 122. Parent POM and BOM (Bill of Materials)

**Parent POM:**

* Inherits build configuration, dependencies, plugins from a central POM

**BOM (Bill of Materials):**

* Manages **version alignment** across multiple dependencies

**Usage:**

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-dependencies</artifactId>
      <version>2.7.0</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

---

### 123. Scaffold Flow in New Mule Project

**What:**

* Automatically generated basic flows when creating a new Mule project using APIKit + RAML

**Includes:**

* Main flow for each HTTP method and endpoint
* Error handling and API Console support

**Why:**

* Speeds up development by wiring flow structure automatically

---

### 124. Can We Import All JAR Files?

**Answer:**

* Yes, but depends **how JAR was exported**:

  * Must include all required classes and resources
  * Must not conflict with core Mule dependencies

**Best Practice:**

* Only import well-scoped JARs with clearly defined APIs

---

### 126. Mule Deployable Archive and Lightweight JARs

**What:**

* Mule deployable archive is a ZIP file that includes:

  * `classes/`, `lib/`, `mule-artifact.json`, `mule-config.xml`, and `app.properties`.
* This format is necessary for Mule runtime deployment.

**Lightweight JAR:**

* Used for sharing common modules/libraries (not runnable on Mule runtime).
* For **developer exchange** and **unit testing**, not actual deployment.

**Why:**

* Ensures compatibility with Mule runtime.

---

### 127. TLS – Cipher Suite, Symmetric & Asymmetric Encryption

**Cipher Suite:**

* Combination of algorithms that define how encryption is handled (e.g., `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`).

**Symmetric Encryption:**

* Uses the **same key** for encryption and decryption (faster, used after handshake).

**Asymmetric Encryption:**

* Uses **public-private key pair** (used during TLS handshake for key exchange).

**Why:**

* TLS uses asymmetric encryption to exchange a symmetric key, which is then used for secure communication.

---

### 128. TLS Handshake – How It Works

1. **Client Hello:** Client sends list of supported cipher suites and TLS version.
2. **Server Hello:** Server picks cipher suite and sends certificate.
3. **Key Exchange:** Server sends public key; client uses it to encrypt a pre-master secret.
4. **Session Key Generation:** Both derive same session key.
5. **Finished:** Secure connection begins using symmetric encryption.

**Why Important:**

* Ensures identity (via certs) and confidentiality (via encryption).

---

### 129. Keystore vs Truststore

**Keystore:**

* Holds **private key** and certificate for your application.
* Used to **prove your identity** to others.

**Truststore:**

* Holds **public certificates** of other systems.
* Used to **validate** external server’s certificate.

**Example:**

```xml
<tls:keystore path="keystore.jks" password="password" />
<tls:truststore path="truststore.jks" password="trustpass" />
```

---

### 130. Why Do We Need Others’ Certs in Truststore?

**Reason:**

* If you're calling an external HTTPS service, Mule needs to **trust its certificate**.
* That server’s cert (or its CA) must exist in your truststore.

**If not present:**

* Connection will fail with `javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException`

---

### 131. TLS, ABDMTLS, Mutual TLS in Mule

**TLS:** Secures the channel using server cert.
**Mutual TLS:** Both server and client present certificates.
**abdmTLS:** Industry-specific implementation (e.g., for Indian ABDM compliance).

**In Mule:**

* Use HTTPS listener or requester with TLS context configured.

---

### 132. Calling HTTPS Without a Cert – Why It Still Works?

* Most public HTTPS APIs use **certificates signed by well-known CAs**.
* Mule JVM includes **default truststore** (cacerts) that contains these CA certs.

**So:**

* Unless overridden, Mule will trust those by default.

---

### 133. JKS to PKCS12 – What & Why?

**JKS:** Java KeyStore (Java proprietary)
**PKCS12:** Standardized format supported outside Java (e.g., browsers)

**Convert using:**

```bash
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore my.jks -destkeystore my.p12 -deststoretype PKCS12
```

---

### 134. Making HTTPS in Mule (End to End)

1. **Create a JKS keystore** with private key and self-signed cert
2. **Place it in `src/main/resources/`**
3. **Configure TLS in Listener:**

```xml
<tls:context>
  <tls:keystore path="keystore.jks" keyPassword="pass" />
</tls:context>
```

4. **Open in Postman:** works since it bypasses browser cert check
5. **Fails in Chrome?**: Chrome blocks self-signed cert unless explicitly trusted

---

### 135. Transaction Types – XA vs Local

**Local:** Works within single resource (like a DB)
**XA:** Distributed transactions across multiple resources (e.g., DB + JMS)

**Use Case:** XA needed if rollback must span multiple systems

---

### 136. Transaction Action – Always Begin, Join, etc.

**Options:**

* `NONE`: No transaction
* `ALWAYS_BEGIN`: Starts a new transaction
* `BEGIN_OR_JOIN`: Starts if none exists; joins if exists
* `ALWAYS_JOIN`: Requires existing transaction (fails if not found)

---

### 137. Try Scope in Transaction Handling

**What Happens in Error:**

* If error is thrown inside `try` and **not handled**, transaction rolls back.
* If **handled**, flow continues — transaction may commit unless explicitly rolled back.

**Best Practice:**

* Place rollback logic inside catch block for fine control.

---

### 138. Other Scopes in Transaction Handling

**Async:**

* Executes outside current thread → **does NOT participate** in transaction

**Until Successful:**

* Retries block until success → **not transactional**, can't rollback changes already made

---

### 139. Async Scope – No Rollback?

**Correct:**

* Runs in separate thread
* Cannot join transaction from parent flow
* Use cautiously with state-changing logic

---

### 140. Until Successful – Thread Blocking?

**Yes.**

* Retries are blocking unless wrapped inside Async (not advised for DB ops)
* Not transactional: partial updates possible if not handled carefully

**Control using:** max retries, delay, and timeout

---

## MuleSoft Developer Prep Notes (Topics 1–155)

...\[Topics 1–140 remain unchanged]...

---

### 141. Parallel For Each with Transactions

**Behavior:**

* When `parallel-for-each` is used, it processes elements concurrently in different threads.
* Transactions are **not supported** across threads.
* If you enable a transaction inside a `parallel-for-each`, it behaves like a **normal For Each** — i.e., disables true parallelism to preserve transaction integrity.

**Tradeoff:**

* You either get **parallelism without transaction**, or **sequential execution with transaction**.

---

### 142. Batch Jobs and Transactions

**Behavior:**

* Batch steps run in **parallel threads** and are **not transaction-aware**.
* Transactions are not preserved across batch steps.

**Implication:**

* If a batch record fails, Mule logs the failure but does not rollback previous successful steps (unless manual rollback mechanisms are implemented).

**Best Practice:**

* Use batch jobs for **high volume, async processing**.
* Avoid relying on transactional behavior within batch jobs.

---

### 143. Transactions in Routers (Scatter-Gather)

**Default Behavior:**

* `scatter-gather` is parallel by default.
* When used with transactions, it will **not execute in parallel**.

**Why:**

* Transactions require single-threaded consistency. Scatter-gather switches to **sequential** execution to respect transaction boundaries.

---

### 144. Flow Reference Inside Transactions

**What Happens:**

* Subflow invoked via `<flow-ref>` will **inherit the parent transaction**.
* The entire transactional context is shared.

**Note:**

* Any rollback in child flow will rollback the main flow transaction as well.

---

### 145. Bitronix Transaction Manager Logging

**Yes.**

* Bitronix is used by Mule for XA transactions.
* It maintains **transaction logs** in `btm-state/` folder for recovery purposes.
* These logs help recover in-doubt transactions on system crash.

---

### 146. Two-Phase Commit Protocol

**What:**

* Used in **XA transactions** to ensure data consistency across multiple systems.

**Steps:**

1. **Prepare Phase:** All participants vote yes/no.
2. **Commit Phase:** If all say yes → commit. If any say no → rollback all.

**Ensures:**

* Atomicity and consistency across systems (e.g., DB and JMS).

---

### 147. Proxy API

**What:**

* An API that acts as a gateway or wrapper to an existing backend API.
* Adds security, logging, or throttling without changing the backend.

**Why:**

* Decouple frontend client access from actual service logic.

**Use Case:**

* Expose legacy SOAP/REST API behind a modern proxy that enforces OAuth2, rate limits, and analytics.

---

### 148. Handling Unauthorized & Bad Requests

**Problem:**

* Not all errors should be retried. Example: 401 (Unauthorized) or 400 (Bad Request)

**Solution:**

* Use **Try Scope** + `On Error Continue`
* Set custom status code in `set-property`:

```xml
<on-error-continue>
  <set-property propertyName="statusCode" value="401" />
</on-error-continue>
```

* Use **Validation inside HTTP Request configuration** to classify errors

**Avoid:**

* Retrying with `until-successful` on permanent errors like 401/400

---

### 149. Client ID Enforcement in RAML and Error Behavior

**What:**

* `client-id-enforcement` trait in RAML adds enforcement logic
* If client ID or secret is missing or invalid:

  * API Manager may return 401, 403, or 400 depending on config

**Status Codes:**

* 401: Missing or invalid credentials
* 403: Forbidden (valid creds, no permission)
* 400: Malformed or missing headers when RAML trait used improperly

---

### 150. RAML Versioning

**Best Practice:**

* Use version in base URI:

```yaml
baseUri: https://api.myorg.com/v1
version: v1
```

* Use different RAML files for each major version.
* Deprecate older versions via documentation and contract management.

---

### 151. RAML baseUri

**What:**

* Defines the root endpoint for your API

**Usage:**

```yaml
baseUri: https://api.acme.com/v1
```

**Why:**

* Standardizes endpoint across environments
* Can be parameterized using `baseUriParameters`

---

### 152. Header Injection Policy – Full Process

**What:**

* A **policy** that injects headers into **inbound or outbound** HTTP requests

**Why:**

* Add metadata, trace IDs, custom identifiers

**Steps:**

1. Apply policy in API Manager
2. Configure key-value headers (e.g., `x-trace-id: ${correlationId}`)
3. Mule runtime injects header automatically

---

### 153. Inbound vs Outbound Header Injection

**Inbound Header Injection:**

* Adds headers to **incoming** requests before they reach the app (internal use)

**Outbound Header Injection:**

* Adds headers to **outgoing** responses or downstream HTTP calls

**Use Case:**

* Tracking, logging, enforcing correlation IDs

**Important:**

* Even if client doesn’t pass headers, policy can inject them for downstream use

---

### 154. Client ID Enforcement

**What:**

* Enforces that API calls include valid **client\_id** and **client\_secret** in headers or query params

**How:**

* Defined as **trait in RAML** + applied via API Manager policy
* Credentials are tied to contracts in API Manager

**Why:**

* Controls API access and enables SLA enforcement

---

### 155. Platform Client ID and Secret – What and Why

**What:**

* Credentials issued by **Anypoint Exchange** or **API Manager** when deploying an API instance

**Used For:**

* **Autodiscovery** to connect deployed runtime app with API Manager

**Why Required:**

* Allows runtime to fetch policies, apply contracts, send analytics
* Without this, API is not governed or monitored by platform

---

### 156. IP Whitelisting, Allowlisting, Blocklisting, Blacklisting

**IP Whitelisting (Allowlisting):**

* Only requests from allowed IPs are permitted.
* Commonly used to secure APIs or admin access.

**Blocklisting (Blacklisting):**

* All IPs are allowed **except** those explicitly denied.

**Use in MuleSoft:**

* Applied at firewall/load balancer level or via **API Gateway policies**.
* Can also be enforced at the VPC or VPN level in CloudHub.

---

### 157. `X-Real-IP` and `X-Forwarded-For`

**What:**

* These headers preserve the original client IP behind proxies or load balancers.

**`X-Real-IP`:**

* Holds **exact client IP** (used by NGINX).

**`X-Forwarded-For`:**

* May contain **comma-separated IPs** (client, proxy1, proxy2...). The first is usually the client.

**Usage:**

* Mule reads these headers via `attributes.headers['X-Forwarded-For']`

---

### 158. JWT in API Manager vs JWT in DataWeave

**In API Manager:**

* You can enforce **JWT validation** via policy.
* Validate claims (e.g., `iss`, `aud`, `exp`) and signature.

**In DataWeave:**

* Parse or generate JWT using the `dw::jwt` module (custom or community).
* Can manually decode base64 payload using:

```dw
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
binary.fromBase64(payload.split(".")[1]) as String
```

---

### 159. JWT Signing Method, Key Origin, JWT Key (PEM)

**Signing Methods:**

* HS256 (HMAC with shared secret)
* RS256 (RSA with private/public key pair)

**Key Origin:**

* Comes from **Identity Provider** (e.g., Auth0, Okta)
* Public key is shared to verify JWT signature

**PEM Format:**

* Encoded public/private keys in Base64 with `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----`
* Used to validate RS256 tokens

---

### 160. JWT Structure: Header.Payload.Signature

**Format:**

* `header.payload.signature`
* Each section is **base64 encoded**
* Signature is generated by **signing `header.payload` with secret or private key**

**Important:**

* **Header:** Algorithm & token type
* **Payload:** Claims (e.g., user, exp, iss)
* **Signature:** Verifies integrity

---

### 161. Error: No Organizational Header – Solution

**Cause:**

* API deployment is missing organization context.

**Fix:**

* In API Manager, set API visibility to **Public**.
* OR ensure `orgId` is properly passed in the API call when required by internal tools.

---

### 162. APIKit Router Strict Validation

**Issue:**

* By default, APIKit **does not restrict extra query/header params** unless configured.

**Risk:**

* Malicious or unexpected parameters can crash app or overload logic.

**Fix:**

* Set **`strict=true`** in APIKit router configuration:

```xml
<apikit:config strict="true" />
```

* Only parameters defined in RAML will be accepted; others return **400**.

---

### 163. APIKit Router – Config for Strict Query Param Validation

**How:**

* Enable strict validation:

```xml
<apikit:config name="apiConfig" strict="true" raml="api.raml" />
```

**Behavior:**

* Any additional query/header params not defined in RAML will result in **HTTP 400**.

---

### 164. PostgreSQL UPSERT – Insert + Update

**Syntax:**

```sql
INSERT INTO users(id, name)
VALUES(1, 'John')
ON CONFLICT(id) DO UPDATE SET name = EXCLUDED.name;
```

**Purpose:**

* Avoids duplicates and allows update if record exists.
* Efficient way to implement "upsert" logic without extra DB round-trips.

---

### 165. Custom Policy – Deep Dive

**Steps:**

1. Create Maven-based Mule Policy project using provided archetype.
2. Define policy YAML metadata (parameters, rules).
3. Write implementation in XML (e.g., check JWT, add headers).
4. Package with `mvn clean package`.
5. Publish to Anypoint Exchange.
6. Apply via API Manager to specific API.

**Use Case:**

* Inject security headers, validate custom logic (e.g., header match or audit logging).

---

### 166. Why Snapshot in Version?

**Snapshot Version:**

* Indicates **non-final development version**, e.g., `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`
* Used for testing or internal sharing before release

**Why:**

* Lets other devs pull the latest build from remote repo like Nexus without strict versioning

---

### 167. Two-Way SSL – Listener with Only Keystore?

**If Only Keystore:**

* Acts as **one-way TLS** – server presents cert to client
* Client **doesn’t authenticate itself**

**For Two-Way SSL (Mutual TLS):**

* Must configure **truststore** as well (to validate client’s cert)

**Browser Issue:**

* Browsers don’t send client cert unless requested
* Hence, mutual TLS often fails in browser unless manually configured

---

### 168. Self-Signed Cert in CloudHub Truststore?

**Yes, it works** if:

* Your self-signed cert is added to the **truststore** of your CloudHub Mule app
* Doesn’t need CA if it’s already trusted explicitly

**But:**

* Not recommended for production – lacks identity verification

---

### 169. Mule 4 Truststore Validation – CA Check?

**No.**

* If a cert is in the **truststore**, Mule **won’t validate CA chain**
* Even a self-signed cert will be accepted

**If Not in Truststore?**

* Mule will reject the cert regardless of CA signing

---

### 170. Kafka – What and Why?

**What:**

* Kafka is a **distributed publish-subscribe messaging platform** built for **real-time data pipelines** and event streaming

**Why Use Kafka vs REST?**

* Handles **high throughput**
* Supports **real-time streaming**
* Built-in **fault tolerance**, **partitioning**, and **replication**
* REST is synchronous; Kafka is async, scalable, better for decoupling systems

---

### 171. Kafka Concepts – Pub/Sub, Events, Volume

**Kafka Supports:**

* **Topics:** Logical channels
* **Producers:** Send data
* **Consumers:** Read data
* **Consumer Groups:** Enable parallelism with coordination
* **Partitions:** Split data for scalability
* **Offset:** Unique ID for each message in a partition

**High Volume:**

* Kafka can handle trillions of events/day with low latency and high durability

---

### 172. Kafka with MuleSoft – Deep Dive

**Integration with Mule 4:**

* Use **Kafka Connector** (publish, consume, batch consume)

**Modes:**

* Publish via flow
* Consume using `on-new-message` or `batch-listener`

**Config Options:**

* **Ack Mode:** Auto/manual
* **Fetch Size:** Controls max bytes pulled per poll
* **Seek/Commit:** Adjust offset manually if needed

**Message Distribution:**

* Kafka assigns messages to partitions (round-robin or custom key-based)
* Only **one consumer per partition** per group processes the message

---

### 173. Kafka Terminologies – Explained

* **Topic:** A stream category
* **Partition:** Sub-division of a topic for load balancing
* **Broker:** Kafka server/node
* **Cluster:** Group of brokers
* **Offset:** Sequence number of message in partition
* **Consumer Group:** Multiple consumers processing messages in parallel
* **Zookeeper:** Manages broker metadata (optional in newer Kafka versions)

**Example:**

* Topic has 3 partitions → 3 messages go to P0, P1, P2 in round robin.
* 2 consumer groups = full parallel processing for independent apps

**Advanced Settings:**
